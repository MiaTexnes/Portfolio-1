First year project to create Portfolio 1 page that i instead made into a website with some more pages with my CV and some information.
I wanted the site to be clean, fun and in my style.

## The site architecture for my site became the following:

1. Home – Index page linking to about me and get in touch
2. Portfolio – Showing the current deliveries at Noroff
3. About – About me and my life
4. Contact – A page with my social links for contact
5. Science museum – About the Science Museum Project
6. Mantis World – About the Mantis World Project
7. Rainy Days – About the Rainy Days Project
8. CV – A page with my CV

## The site was built with:

-   [HTML]
-   [CSS]
-   [JS]
-   [Tailwind]

## The assignment was to create a functional web site with the following requirements:

1. Create a personal portfolio webpage that lists the 3 projects as cards. These cards must have a screenshot of the project and a link to the live site.
